# Angufive

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.5.

## Development server

For development only

1. Run `nodemon server/index.js` for the Express server that handles receiving the API calls. The file will automatically run again if you make any changes.

1. In a different terminal, run `npm run dev` for a dev server with configured proxy to the API. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` for the app. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
